# WASD 2D Movement Demo (Modified)

## Description
This Unity project is a modification of Proffesor Pisan's [WASD Movement (2D)](https://github.com/t4guw/100-Unity-Mechanics-for-Programmers/tree/master/programs/wasd_movement_2d). This modification completely reworks the movement scripts of the project to implement acceleration and dampening for the controllable character. Collision detection is also included to prevent the character from escaping the visible play area.

The WebGL build of the project can be played [here](https://ringman3640.github.io/unity-wasd-2d-movement-demo/WebGL%20Build/).
